# Newstory Server

The Inferno Server is a Showdown Boilerplate (a template for [Pokémon Showdown](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown)
private servers).

What is a boilerplate? Boilerplate is any text that is or can be reused in new
contexts or applications without being greatly changed from the original.

This repository contains the files needed to set up your own Pokémon Showdown
server with all the amazing stuff that private Pokémon Showdown servers like
Origin, Frost, or Pandora has.

All credit goes to Creaturephil for the Showdown Boilerplate code. 


## Features

- Numerous *cool* commands such as /urbandefine or /poof
- Emoticons in chat and private messages
- Polls, Hangman, Profile, Tells, Night Club, TCs, and Anagrams
- So many tiers that even the Original Showdown Boilerplate doesn't have, like Random Tiers and Local Metagames, as along with different forms of Monotype.
- For staff members, you can use /shadowban to shadowban users and /permaban ( if & and above) to permaban a user from the server.
- Economy (bucks system, shop, tournament winnings, lottery)
- Slots and Anagrams with buck winnings.
- An area where leagues can hang out in. 
- Lowdb and MySql database support

## Quick Start
